## Task

### Part A: Write a Setup Script (7 marks)

Inside a folder named `automation_scripts/`, create a file called `setup.sh`. The script must:

1. Create a folder called `project_folder/`  
2. Inside it, create two folders: `src/` and `docs/`  
3. Create a JavaScript file inside `src/` called `index.js` with this line:
   ```bash
   echo "console.log('Project started');" > project_folder/src/index.js
   ```
4. Print this after setup is complete:
   ```bash
   echo "âœ… Folder structure created successfully!"
   ```

Run your script using:
```bash
bash automation_scripts/setup.sh
```
5. Push your work to github.
